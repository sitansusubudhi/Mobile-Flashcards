# Mobile Flashcards Project

The "Mobile Flashcards" is a React Native app for Android that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

For this application, most of the applicationâ€™s state is managed by Redux.
